Credit card applications\n","<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n","<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>\n","<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>\n","<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>\n","<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>\n","<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1766,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"id":"sMft9R1L6ejS","tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import libraries\n","import pandas as

3. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets\n","<p>Now, we will split our data into train set and test set to prepare our data for two different phases of machine learning modeling: training and testing. Ideally, no information from the test data should be used to preprocess the training data or should be used to direct the training process of a machine learning model. Hence, we first split the data and then preprocess it.</p>\n","<p>Also, features like <code>DriversLicense</code> and <code>ZipCode</code> are not as important as the other features in the dataset for predicting credit card approvals. To get a better sense, we can measure their <a href=\"https://realpython.com/numpy-scipy-pandas-correlation-python/\">statistical correlation</a> to the labels of the dataset. But this is out of scope for this project. We should drop them to design our machine learning model with the best set of features.

9. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set\n","<p>Essentially, predicting if a credit card application will be approved or not is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification\">classification</a> task. According to UCI, our dataset contains more instances that correspond to \"Denied\" status than instances corresponding to \"Approved\" status. Specifically, out of 690 instances, there are 383 (55.5%) applications that got denied and 307 (44.5%) applications that got approved. </p>\n","<p>This gives us a benchmark. A good machine learning model should be able to accurately predict the status of the applications with respect to these statistics.</p>\n","<p>Which model should we pick? A question to ask is: <em>are the features that affect the credit card approval decision process correlated with each other?</em> Although we can measure correlation, that is outside the scope of this notebook, so we'll rely on our intuition that they indeed are correlated for now. Because of this correlation, we'll take advantage of the fact that generalized linear models perform well in these cases. Let's start our machine learning modeling with a Logistic Regression model (a generalized linear model).</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1806,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import LogisticRegression Class\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1807,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"59"},"id":"_EyjlPRZ6ejf","tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-36 {\n","  /* Definition of color scheme common for light and dark mode */\n","  --sklearn-color-text: black;\n","  --sklearn-color-line: gray;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for unfitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-0: #fff5e6;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-1: #f6e4d2;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-2: #ffe0b3;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-3: chocolate;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for fitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-0: #f0f8ff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-1: #d4ebff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-2: #b3dbfd;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-3: cornflowerblue;\n","\n","  /* Specific color for light theme */\n","  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, white)));\n","  --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-icon: #696969;\n","\n","  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n","    /* Redefinition of color scheme for dark theme */\n","    --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, #111)));\n","    --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-icon: #878787;\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-36 {\n","  color: var(--sklearn-color-text);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-36 pre {\n","  padding: 0;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-36 input.sk-hidden--visually {\n","  border: 0;\n","  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);\n","  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n","  height: 1px;\n","  margin: -1px;\n","  overflow: hidden;\n","  padding: 0;\n","  position: absolute;\n","  width: 1px;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-36 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {\n","  border: 1px dashed var(--sklearn-color-line);\n","  margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;\n","  box-sizing: border-box;\n","  padding-bottom: 0.4em;\n","  background-color: var(--sklearn-color-background);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-36 div.sk-container {\n","  /* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none;
