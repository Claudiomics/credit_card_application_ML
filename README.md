## Introduction 

This is the first machine learning lab I've completed, as an automated service to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or denied. The code is outlined in 'Credit_Card_Lab.ipynb' with lots of notes for my own learning and development. The original lab document supplied by Peregrine is the 'notebook.ipynb'.

I will be typing up my project and what I've learned on this README.md document.

## Installation 

__Download the Jupyter Notebook File:__

Download the .ipynb file and add it to your project folder.

```
notebook.ipynb
```

__Download the Dataset:__

Download the file containing the credit card application information from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](#https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval) and add the crx.data file to the same folder as your notebook. 

__Set Up Your Environment:__

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system, and create a project-specific environment for this project by following these steps:

1. Open your command line terminal and navigate to your project folder.
```
cd path/to/projectfolder
```

2. Create a virtual enviroment and activate it:

Still in the open folder of the project in the terminal, add the following:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
to create it and:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
to activate it (on macOS).

3. Install necessary packages:

```
pip install ipykernel pandas numpy
```
4. Connect via VSCode:

Open VSCode and install the Jupyter extension in VSCode by searching 'Jupyter' in _Extensions_ view and clicking install.

Open your project folder in VSCode and open your .ipynb file.

Open the command palette by using 

```
Ctrl+Shift+P
```

and selecting 'Python: Select Interpreter'.

Select the Python environment you just created (venv) within your kernel, and you should be able to run the notebook.
